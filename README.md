# ABCD_multivar

This code can be launched in the "analysis" folder by doing:
-->    ./LaunchAnalysis.sh [path-to-payload]

An example payload is provided in the payloads directory. The ONLY thing that should be changed is the payload, everything else is automated!

Please create a "results" directory (ourside analysis) for the script to write to.

You will also need to install combine.
